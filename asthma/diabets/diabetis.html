          <p style="font-size:20px;">  Diabetes is a disease that occurs when your blood glucose, also called blood sugar, is too high. Blood glucose is your main source of energy and comes from the food you eat. Insulin, a hormone made by the pancreas, helps glucose from food get into your cells to be used for energy. Sometimes your body doesn’t make enough—or any—insulin or doesn’t use insulin well. 
            Glucose then stays in your blood and doesn’t reach your cells.

        <h1 style="color:brown ;">What  are the health problems  with diabetes ?</h1>
        <p>Over time, high blood glucose leads to problems such as</p>
        <li>heart disease</li>
        <li>nerve damage</li>
        <li>stroke</li>
        <li>kidney disease</li>

    <h2>What are the different types of diabetes?</h2>
    <h3>Type 1 diabetes</h3>
    <p>If you have type 1 diabetes, your body does not make insulin. Your immune system attacks and destroys the cells in your pancreas that make 
        insulin. Type 1 diabetes is usually diagnosed in children and young adults, although it can appear at any age. People with type 1 diabetes 
        need to take insulin every day to stay alive.</p>
    <h3> Type 1 diabetes</h3>
    <p>If you have type 2 diabetes, your body does not make or use insulin well. You can develop type 2 diabetes at any age, even during childhood.
         However, this type of diabetes occurs most often in middle-aged and older people. Type 2 is the most common type of diabetes</p>
    <h3>Gestational diabetes</h3>
    <p>
        Gestational diabetes develops in some women when they are pregnant. Most of the time, this type of diabetes goes away after the baby 
        is born. However, if you’ve had gestational diabetes, you have a greater chance of developing type 2 diabetes later in life. Sometimes 
        diabetes diagnosed during pregnancy is actually type 2 diabetes.

        <h1 style="color:brown ;">More healthy eating tips</h1>
        <p>There are many different strategies for healthy eating. Here are some of the basics that you may find helpful.</p>
        <li>Learn to read food nutrition labels so you know what’s in your food and how it could affect your blood sugar.</li>
        <li>Foods high in fiber can help prevent glucose spikes. Fiber is a helpful nutrient found in plant foods
             (vegetables, fruits, beans, and whole grains) that can slow carbohydrate digestion and help manage blood sugar levels.</li>
        <li>Understanding portion size is important for all types of food and can help you make sure you are eating a balanced diet</li>
        <li>Build colorful meals to make sure you are getting a wide variety of nutrients. Filling your plate with foods of different
             colors means a focus on eating lots of veggies and some fruit.</li>
        <li>Drink water to keep your body hydrated</li>
